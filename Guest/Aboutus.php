			At academic grounds, we help solve the everyday communications challenges that all schools face.			
			We believe schools can change educational outcomes if they can improve how they share information. We help schools use their website and other web communications to do just that, and bring the entire school community closer.

				<h3><font size="20px">Our team is your team.</font></h3>
				<p>
				Our Campus Suite team is comprised of designers, developers, project leaders, and support specialists who all come together to create better ways for schools to communicate via the web.

				We're in this together. Among our team members are former school PR professionals and former teachers, many of whom are parents themselves. You might say we take our work home with us, living and knowing firsthand the importance of school-parent engagement.
